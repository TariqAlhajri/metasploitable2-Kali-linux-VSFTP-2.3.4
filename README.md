# metasploitable2-Kali-linux-VSFTP-2.3.4
this project is about exploiting matasploitable2 vulnerability VSFTP 2.3.4 using kali linux

Vulnerability:

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.
VSFTP 2.3.4 This update of VSFTPD includes a loophole that was created by an attacker. While the backdoor was found and immediately deleted by the developers, several users downloaded and installed the backdoor version of VSFTPD. The backdoor payload is started in response to a:) character combination in the username which represents a smiley face.
